def diameter(G, seed=None):
    """Returns a lower bound on the diameter of the graph G.

    The function computes a lower bound on the diameter (i.e., the maximum eccentricity)
    of a directed or undirected graph G. The procedure used varies depending on the graph
    being directed or not.

    If G is an `undirected` graph, then the `2-sweep` procedure is being used [1]_.
    The main idea is to pick the farthest node from a random node and return its eccentricity.

    Otherwise, if G is a `directed` graph, then the directed version of the 2-sweep
    algorithm is used, referred to as `2-dSweep` [2]_. The procedure starts by selecting
    a random source node $s$ from which it performs a forward and a backward BFS.
    Let $a_1$ and $a_2$ be the farthest nodes in the forward and backward cases, respectively.
    Then, it computes the backward eccentricity of $a_1$ using a backward BFS and the
    forward eccentricity of $a_2$ using a forward BFS. Finally, it returns the best
    bound between the two.

    In both cases, the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    d : integer
       Lower Bound on the Diameter of G

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the graph is empty or
        If the graph is undirected and not connected or
        If the graph is directed and not strongly connected.
